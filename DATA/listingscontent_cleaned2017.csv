Driving Around:::: Most guests seem to seem prefer driving because our location is such a great hub, as described in the overview and in more detail in the first house manual.  Just be wary of rush hour traffic on I-84 and I-205 and I-5 as Portland's population and popularity are growing! Also to note, Portland has great car rental options if you need it with Flight Car (it's the Airbnb of car renting!), Car 2 Go, Zip Car, and the many other usual car rental businesses.

We live a couple blocks from the 71 and 72 bus stops, and the southbound 72 bus takes you to the nearest MAX station in 10 minutes.  MAX is Portland's mass transit rail system and it will take you all over Downtown Portland.
